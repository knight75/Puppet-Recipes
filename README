Just to keep some recipes between home and work and being able o modify them no matter where i am.
thses recipes are mostly puppet modules.
And of course, every idea to get better use of puppet is welcome


for information, I own 3 pcs (2 with ubuntu 10.04 and 1 with 11.04) plus 4 vms under centos 4 and 5 and debian lenny and squeeze.

My goal is to write recipes for thses hosts that i could deploy on each one and get back with git
